1. Multi-Feature-Based Fully Connected Neural Network:
   The FCNN was built in Python environment. This analysis utilized a dataset containing 27 input features extracted from neuroimaging data, with labels representing brain age. The FCNN model is structured as follows: the input layer accepts 27 features, the hidden layers structure is: [128 neurons, 64 neurons, 32 neurons, 16 neurons], all hidden layers are followed by batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activation. Output Layer: A linear layer that predicts the brain age. The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. The weights are initialized using the He initialization strategy. The training process involves iterating through the dataset for 300 epochs, where each batch is processed to update the model weights. The training loss is recorded for monitoring the convergence of the model. 
 Additionally, the model is evaluated on a validation set, with performance metrics including R², mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated to assess the accuracy of the brain age predictions. Data augmentation techniques including … are also employed to enhance the robustness of the model by randomly manipulating the input data.

   Highlights:
   1. Brain-age was predicted from 5 different MRI sequences.
   2. By employing a three-branch architecture using ASL + SWI, T2 flair + fMRI, and DTI, we achieved information interaction between different sequences through a machine learning-based fully connected layer     neural network, enhancing the predictive capability for brain age.
   3. Twenty-seven MRI features from white matter microstructures, siderosis and brain vessels were informative for brain-age progression.
   4. Brain-age progression was associated with frailty.

 Abstract: 
   Introduction: The brain-age paradigm is a valuable tool for studying aging-related diseases and predicting health outcomes, primarily focusing on structural neuroimaging to assess brain volume changes. However, when organic lesions occur, timely treatment becomes challenging. This study employs multimodality MRI to investigate early microstructural changes related to brain aging.
   Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank, we modeled brain-age in a cohort of healthy individuals by integrating T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and task-based functional MRI (fMRI). To manage incomplete sequence scans, we grouped the modalities into three categories: 1) ASL + SWI (cerebral blood flow and siderosis), 2) T2-FLAIR + fMRI (white matter and cortical structure), and 3) DTI (white matter fiber diffusion). We used a fully connected neural network to predict brain age from these features, 
   Results: Twenty-seven neuroimaging phenotypes were identified as significant predictors, highlighting changes in white matter microstructure, cerebral blood flow, iron deposition, and brain dynamics. Notably, features intracellular  and isotropic volume fraction in specific brain tracts correlated significantly with frailty (p=???), indicating that these features may serve as potential biomarkers for brain aging. achieving an R² of 0.8070, MAE of 2.8233, and RMSE of 3.5381. 
   Conclusions: This study underscores the predictive power of multimodal neuroimaging in estimating brain-age and its relationship with frailty.
