1. Multi-Feature-Based Fully Connected Neural Network:
   The FCNN was built in Python environment. This analysis utilized a dataset containing 27 input features extracted from neuroimaging data, with labels representing brain age. The FCNN model is structured as follows: the input layer accepts 27 features, the hidden layers structure is: [128 neurons, 64 neurons, 32 neurons, 16 neurons], all hidden layers are followed by batch normalization and Leaky ReLU activation. Output Layer: A linear layer that predicts the brain age. The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. The weights are initialized using the He initialization strategy. The training process involves iterating through the dataset for 300 epochs, where each batch is processed to update the model weights. The training loss is recorded for monitoring the convergence of the model. 
 Additionally, the model is evaluated on a validation set, with performance metrics including R², mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated to assess the accuracy of the brain age predictions. Data augmentation techniques including … are also employed to enhance the robustness of the model by randomly manipulating the input data.



   Project Title: Machine learning-based MRI brain-age prediction and relationship to frailty index
   Highlights:
   1. Brain-age was predicted from 5 different MRI sequences.
   2. By employing a three-branch architecture using ASL + SWI, T2 flair + fMRI, and DTI, we achieved information interaction between different sequences through a machine learning-based fully connected layer     neural network, enhancing the predictive capability for brain age.
   3. Twenty-seven MRI features from white matter microstructures, siderosis and brain vessels were informative for brain-age progression.
   4. Brain-age progression was associated with frailty.

 Full Synopsis and Impact:
Motivation: Structural MRI-based brain-age models primarily capture volumetric changes, often missing early microstructural alterations that precede macroscopic atrophy. A multimodal approach is needed to detect these subtle changes for earlier intervention.

Goal: To develop a multimodal neuroimaging model for accurate brain-age estimation and validate its correlation with clinical frailty.

Approach: Using UK Biobank data, we integrated T2-FLAIR, DTI, ASL, SWI, and task-fMRI through a fully connected neural network. The brain age prediction model was initially trained on 79 healthy participants and subsequently validated on an augmented cohort of 579 subjects. We further investigated the relationship between brain-age features and frailty in 724 adults (age range: 50-85 years; frailty index range: 0-3).

Results: The model achieved R²=0.81, MAE=2.82 years, RMSE=3.54 years. Key predictors included white matter microstructure (ICVF, ISOVF), cerebral blood flow, and iron deposition, which correlated significantly with frailty measures. 

Impact: Our framework provides a fast, accurate biomarker for brain aging linked to frailty, enabling early detection and offering immediate potential for clinical trials and monitoring.
